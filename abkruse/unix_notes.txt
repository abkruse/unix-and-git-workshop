cd - change directory, i.e. cd notes
ls - lists items in working directory
less - shows all contents (less is more)

ll - long list (ls -l) lists sizes
>> redirection and adds whatever is in a file to the new file
cat - I dunno

subl - open Sublime text
mv - MOVE:  mv file path/dir newfile/dirname
touch - create file
